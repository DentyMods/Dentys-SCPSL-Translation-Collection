# Menu Translations

## Why is there a bunch of folders?
 * These folders mark each game version, We suggest using the latest version to make sure nothing breaks, This also makes it easier for me to create new themes.

<br />
To download a theme just download this github and drag one of the folders into your translations folder, Video below https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXZpNtWNwfs
